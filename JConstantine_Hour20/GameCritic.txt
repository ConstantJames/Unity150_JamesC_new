Hour 20 Game Critic

1.
The game is easy in my opinion because
A: The good pickups move a bit too slow which makes them really easy to line up to.
B: The good pickups give you a bit too much time which makes it really easy to build up time
C: The obstacles do not lower the time enough which makes it really easy to recover from a hit.

2.
The three things I would change to make the game harder would be.
A: Increase the speed of the pickups and obstacles slightly.
B: Reduce the added time on the pickups from 1.5 seconds to 1.25 seconds.
C: Increase the lost time on the obsticles from -0.5 seconds to -0.75 seconds

3.
Three things that would give the game a "wow" factor are
A: Adding some music to the game
B: Changing the mesh of the obstacle to something more menacing
C: Adding more to the enviornment so it's not just a floating floor in the void

4.
Three things in the game that are fun are
A: Weaving between the obstacles
B: Getting a couple powerups in a row in quick succession
C: Building up a really high timer 

5.
Some things that make the game tedious to me are
A: Since a high time is the end goal. It can feel tedious if you are done playing and you have built up a high time remaining
B: The game is visually very simple and that can feel repetitive very quickly
C: The fact that the game stays at the same speed and does not slowly speed up over time makes it feel very tedious to me
